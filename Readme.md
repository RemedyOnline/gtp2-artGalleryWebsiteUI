## This project is my second lab work for the gpt program...

# I must say that replicating the UI given was an easy task but Nyame adom nti, we were able to sail through...

# This project gave me the chance to learn about and use a couple of stuffs for the first time...

For instance,

- the <picture> element, and with its <source> sub-elements, along side the "srcset" attribute... this element allowed me to render different images on the website dynamically, based on the current screen size at any point in time.
- the "mix-blend-mode" attribute which allowed me to display a block of text in a particular dynamically, based on the color of the background the text finds itself on.
